- Find the best machine learning model and params for a given dataset. You will do this following the instructions on the Kaggle competition with your cohort name, i.e. **diamonds-datamad0321**, https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0321


## Deliverables

- **Jupyter notebooks** where you show the process you followed to get to your submissions.

- A **slide** (.ppt, ipynb, etc) with a summary of the metrics you obtained and the rationale behind it. 
    - Why do those params work better than others?
